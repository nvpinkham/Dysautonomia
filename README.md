# Dysautonomia
R code used in "Gut microbiome dysbiosis drives metabolic dysfunction in Familial dysautonomia"

Each sample's meta data is found in the "data" folder alongside metabolite and OTU tables
Raw sequencing data is avilible at under bioproject PRJNA785599 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA785599

R folder contains the custom R
Man folder contains function documentation 

The scripts for creating each figure are in the associated folders
 - these scripts are supposed to be run in their parent directory (same directory as this document)


### Time estimates for R scripts associated with each figure:

 figure 1:\
  a. < 10 sec.\
  b. 10 - 15 minutes for permutation analysis * change number "num.perm" to run few permutations to speed up process\
  c. 10 - 15 minutes for permutation analysis\
  d. < 10 sec.\
  e. < 10 sec.\
  
 figure 2:\
  a. 3 - 5 minutes for Random Forest annalysis\
  b. 10 - 15 minutes for permutation analysis\
  c. < 10 sec.\
  d. < 10 sec.\
  
 figure 3:\
